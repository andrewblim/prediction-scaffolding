This is a simple script that provides the scaffolding for data prediction projects. My intention was to use it for Kaggle competitions but you could use it for any data prediction project. 

At present it just handles command-line flags and error messages, but as I try out various things I will try to add whatever code I think will be generically useful for other data prediction projects.
